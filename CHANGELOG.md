- thanks to **store88** for spotting both of the above!

## version 1.3.5 (September 08, 2013)

- dialog boxes can now be kept open on button click; previously there was no way of keeping a dialog box from closing when a button was clicked; now, returning FALSE from the callback will do just that;

## version 1.3.2 (May 26, 2013)

- fixed a bug where if the "reposition_speed" property was &gt; 0 and the browser window was manually resized, the animations for repositioning the window would queue up and slow down the process to almost a complete halt;

## version 1.3.1 (May 06, 2013)

- fixed a bug where the dialog box was not looking 100% as expected if the page it was used on had the "box-sizing" CSS property set to "border-box", which is the default for some widely-used CSS frameworks like [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) and [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/).

## version 1.1.1 (September 24, 2011)

## version 1.1 (August 18, 2011)

- the last button of the dialog box will now have the focus once the dialog box is open. previously, for any dialog boxes other than notifications, if the user pressed the ENTER key, it re-triggered the event and more dialog boxes were shown one on top of the other; thanks to **Yasir** for reporting;
